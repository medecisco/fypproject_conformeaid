# fypproject

A Flutter project, that I have finished developed for my final year project 

this is entirely a newbie project done for my compulsory university course.
code may look so messy cause it is my first time working with dart and flutter framework.

main focus:- predict female menstrual cycle -> improve adherence of contraceptive intake (if user choose to take it)

aim:- trying to get the model to personalize with users data to further improve accuracy of prediction
